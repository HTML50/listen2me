# listen2me

**an article&music player**

listen2me is an article player, which can play (word by word) an article at author's typing pace. I call it as a player because it plays both article and music. Of course the article is written with listening to some music too.

My intention is to let readers understand and feel writer's emotion when he/she wrties his lines and to know where writer's idea comes from. 

The player has two part, one is player and the other is editor. You can wrtie your own thought with editor,  when you finish writing, you can watch it in player.
